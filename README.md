# Pipex

The pipex project aims to replicate the functionality of the Unix shell's pipe feature.

The goal is to run the first command, take its output, and use it as the input for the second command, similar to how the Unix pipe operator (|) works.

To accomplish this, we need to set up pipelines, create child processes, and manage the file descriptors to redirect standard input and output as required. 

This project teaches about process management, file I/O, and interprocess communication.

It encourages to understand how pipes work behind the scenes in Unix-like operating systems and provides practical experience in working with system calls and managing the execution of multiple processes.
